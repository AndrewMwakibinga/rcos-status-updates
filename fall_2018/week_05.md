Last week I located sites to learn VueJs from and began exploring the in's and out's of the language's library. This week I will complete the User Registration model and I hope to aid knocking out all the other preliminary designs for the backend so we can make major advances forward. For example, testing the models and controllers so that they can finally be pushed to the master branch.
