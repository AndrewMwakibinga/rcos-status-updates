I discovered while working with the project TA that the "verify attendance page for mentors to show live data (#136)" task assigned to me had been completed by another teammate over the summer. Instead, I picked up the task of removing the "commit" functionality from code base since it is barely functional for practical purpose and has little value from an administrative perspective. I also plan to begin slide for project presentation on 11/30, during thanksgiving break.
